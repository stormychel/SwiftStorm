# SwiftStorm

**SwiftStorm** is a unified development workspace for Michel Storms‚Äô Swift packages ‚Äî a local Xcode project that brings multiple Swift Package Manager modules together for rapid iteration, testing, and cross-platform validation.

The project acts as a *storm lab* for modular Swift development:  
each subpackage (e.g. *AudioStorm*, *FileStorm*, *LogStorm*, *TimeStorm*) focuses on a core system domain while remaining interoperable through consistent design patterns and shared foundations.

Built with **SwiftUI** and **Swift Package Manager**, SwiftStorm supports both macOS and iOS targets under a single multiplatform workspace.  
It serves as both a code incubator and a test harness for reusable Swift components that power larger projects.
